## 🔍 **Final Quality Check**

### **Test All Agents** ✅
```bash
# Quick verification tests
cd "/Users/Zay/Desktop/Dev Work 2025/coding agent/coder-buddy"
source .venv/bin/activate

# Test 1: Instant generation
python3 agents/simple_local_agent.py "Create a calculator"
# Expected: 0.1s, browser opens, working calculator

# Test 2: Local AI generation
python3 agents/pure_local_coder.py "Create a todo app"
# Expected: ~13s, browser opens, professional todo app

# Test 3: Cloud generation (if API key available)
python3 agents/simple_coder.py "Create a portfolio"
# Expected: ~25s, browser opens, premium portfolio

# Test 4: Interactive mode
python3 agents/simple_local_agent.py
# Expected: Prompts for input, generates based on user prompt
```

### **Repository Validation** ✅
